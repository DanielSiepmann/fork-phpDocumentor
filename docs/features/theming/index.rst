Theming
=======

With phpDocumentor, you can influence the way the your documentation looks and feels. To make this happen, we provide
several configuration options and -for advanced use- you can even override pieces of the documentation using Twig.

.. warning::

   Sorry, but the Twig templates are not covered by Semantic Versioning and we cannot guarantee backwards compatibility
   when you provide your own overrides. Introducing new language features may require changes for which we cannot
   maintain backwards compatibility in our templates.
